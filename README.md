**Introduction**

This report outlines my iterative journey in enhancing a generic genetic programming (GP) implementation for symbolic regression. Starting with a baseline approach featuring random mutation, subtree crossover, and tournament selection, I identified and addressed several challenges, including tree bloat and fitness stagnation, through systematic modifications and strategy refinements.

**Initial Observations and Challenges**

The baseline implementation exhibited two significant issues:

1. **Excessive Tree Growth:** The GP algorithm generated increasingly large trees, which complicated interpretability and severely impacted computational efficiency.
2. **Fitness Oscillations:** The fitness values fluctuated unpredictably, suggesting inefficiencies in the selection and variation operators.

**Introducing Elitism**

To stabilize fitness progression, I incorporated an elitism strategy, ensuring that top-performing individuals survived across generations. This adjustment enhanced the effectiveness of crossover and mutation operators, but the issue of tree growth persisted, leading to inflated expressions and extended computation times.

---

**Early Optimization Attempts**

At first, I misattributed the performance bottleneck to inefficiencies in computation rather than tree size. To address this, I:

- **Optimized Fitness Evaluation:** Leveraged NumPy broadcasting and implemented parallelization and caching mechanisms to accelerate fitness evaluations, the computationally heaviest component.
- **Results:** These changes yielded moderate improvements, but the performance disparity with my peers' implementations remained.

**Addressing Bloating**

After further investigation, I identified tree bloat—uncontrolled growth of tree structures—as the primary issue. Tackling this required mechanisms to evaluate and constrain tree complexity:

1. **Complexity Evaluation:**
    - Implemented a function to count tree nodes and modified the `Node` class to track depth.
    - Added constraints to limit maximum depth during tree generation and mutation.
2. **Mutation Refinement:**
    - Replaced the random mutation mechanism with a depth-aware approach. The new method generated subtrees proportional to the depth of the mutated node, preventing excessive growth.

---

**Promoting Simplicity**

To further combat bloating and encourage concise expressions, I introduced additional strategies:

1. **Expression Reduction:**
    - Simplified trees by precomputing operations involving constant operands.
2. **Multi-Objective Selection:**
    - Implemented Pareto front selection to balance fitness and complexity. This method identified optimal individuals based on both criteria, discarding solutions with poor fitness or unnecessary complexity.
    - Results: This single change significantly improved convergence speed and sustained progress across generations, overcoming the local minima stagnation often encountered with tournament selection.

**Improving Variation Operators**

With a more effective selection mechanism in place, I revisited the crossover and mutation operators:

1. **Crossover:**
    - Retained the standard subtree swap approach due to its robustness.
2. **Mutation:**
    - Introduced a random selection mechanism that chose between multiple mutation methods. This diversity helped escape local minima and reduced redundancy in the population, fostering greater exploration of the solution space.

Additionally, observing the effectiveness of the new selection mechanism, I increased the probabilities of crossover and mutation being applied, thereby reducing the likelihood of individuals passing unchanged to the next generation. This approach complemented the elitism strategy, which preserved the best individuals, ensuring a balance between retaining high-quality solutions and introducing sufficient variation.

**Incorporating Extinction Events**

To address stagnation during later stages of evolution, I implemented an extinction mechanism. Given time constraints, I opted for a straightforward strategy:

- **Extinction Criteria:** Triggered extinction after a specified number of generations without improvement.
- **Population Pruning:** Removed the bottom 40% of individuals based on combined fitness and complexity, replacing them with newly generated individuals.
- **Impact:** This "soft restart" preserved prior improvements while reintroducing diversity, enabling exploration of new solutions.

**Conclusion**

Through iterative refinements, the genetic programming implementation evolved into a robust and efficient symbolic regression tool. Key modifications—including elitism, complexity management, Pareto front selection, enhanced variation operators, and extinction events—collectively addressed the challenges of tree bloat and fitness stagnation. These advancements resulted in faster convergence, improved solution quality, and a more computationally efficient algorithm.
